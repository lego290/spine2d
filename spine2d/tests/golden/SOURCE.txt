Status: OK
Notes:
  This directory contains golden dumps produced by the C++ oracle (built from spine-c + spine-cpp):
  - Pose dumps: `oracle_scenarios/` and `oracle_scenarios_skel/` (recorded by `scripts/record_oracle_goldens.py`)
  - Render dumps: `render_oracle_scenarios/` and `render_oracle_scenarios_skel/` (recorded by `scripts/record_oracle_render_goldens.py`)
  When the upstream baseline changes, these files must be re-recorded to avoid false test failures.
